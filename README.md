Customer Segmentation using RFM Model Techniques and K-Means Clustering

Why do we need to use customer segmentation in any product or service-based company? 
the answer would be, to provide better services, experiences, offers, discounts, and 
best-related product recommendations to satisfy the customer needs in the best way possible 
and to keep them connected. 
Here, in this Project the main steps are

1. Loading the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data preprocessing techniques like dropping the missing and duplicate values
4. RFM model techniques. We calculate Recency, fequency, and monetary values and give customer loyalty badges.
5. K- Means clustering
